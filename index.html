  <p>Team is tasked with building a 23-page user flow for treasury with a deadline 12 business days away. Everyone got busy; PM finding out what was required from treasury, designers madly working up some screens, and engineers doing all preliminary work setting up API integrations. A few days in, a decision from the top is taken to suddenly move 90% of the flow to an external platform. As a result, the team who had frantically brought in 3 extra engineers and an extra designer, were next-to finished their delivery 8 days ahead of schedule. The designers jumped on the opportunity to flesh out the existing work (4 pages), converting it from a static web page to a dynamic, user-engaging process with less info all-at-once.</p>
